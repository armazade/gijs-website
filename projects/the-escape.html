                            For this neighborhood, the goal was to restore the relationship we have with food
                            and nature. Since industrialization, people have lost their connection to the food
                            they are eating, becoming less aware of what they eat and where it comes from.
                            To restore this relationship, the design organizes strong communities that adhere
                            to the feeling of "midding."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Midding means: feeling the tranquil pleasure of being near a gathering but not
                            quite in it, feeling blissfully invisible yet still fully included, safe in the
                            knowledge that everyone is together and everyone is okay, with all the thrill of
                            being there without the burden of having to be.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The neighborhood is meant to be a place where people can escape from their daily
                            hassles and enjoy a receptive culinary cultural place, where fresh food comes
                            directly from the land, thereby contributing to restoring the relationship we
                            have with food.

                            <strong>Main Path:</strong> The neighborhood is built on the cross-section of
                            pathways leading to the harvest neighborhood and the research neighborhood.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Raised Pathway:</strong> To allow enough space for delivery vessels from
                            the floating farms, the pathway is raised. Underneath, ships can dock and storage
                            is placed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Openings & Different Volumes:</strong> To break the linearity of the
                            neighborhood, certain squares and openings are added. Here terraces can be placed
                            or markets can be held.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Encapsulated Street:</strong> The main street is embraced by windows that
                            curve above the street. In each bay window, there is part of the kitchen of the
                            apartments on top. The result is a bustling culinary street in which the private
                            and public spaces blend.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The street is lined with buildings of different height and depth to give variety
                            in the streetscape and provide space for different accommodations. The final
                            result is a picturesque culinary neighborhood  it has something for everyone
                            and is scattered with many hidden surprises.
